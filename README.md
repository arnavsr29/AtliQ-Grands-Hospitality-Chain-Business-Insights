# 🏨 AtliQ Grands – Hospitality Chain Business Insights

## 📈 Overall Analysis View

In the fast-paced world of luxury hotels, Atliq Grands is a chain who owns multiple five-star hotels. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. Below is a quick glimpse of some noteworthy facts about AtliQ Grands:

➡️AtliQ Grands proudly stands as a five-star hotel chain with a presence in four bustling cities.

➡️Across these urban hubs, AtliQ Grands boasts a network of seven distinct properties, strategically situated to cater to diverse clientele.

➡️Within these upscale properties, guests are offered a choice of four room categories: Elite, Premium, Presidential, and Standard, ensuring a tailored experience for every visitor.

➡️To enhance guest convenience, AtliQ Grands offers reservations through six prominent booking platforms, optimizing accessibility and ease of booking.

So, as a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
